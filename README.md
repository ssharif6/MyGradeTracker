# MyGradeTracker
Often, college students are frustrated by their grade at the end of their term because they were simply unaware of where they stood in the class. MyGrade Tracker is an application geared towards students that allow users to track their grades and see their overall percentages in their classes. Through MyGrade Tracker's simple user-interface, the user is easily able to create a class tab, input the percentages for each category and store individual grades for that class (the user can create as many classes as they want). With a simple swipe gesture to the left left or right near the top half of the screen, the user can view his or her different classes and the courses' corresponding assignments and grades. Unlike other GPA calculators on the market, this application not only calculates your final percentage, but also stores graded assignments and conveniently allows the user to see them in the class page.
MyGrade Tracker is a simple solution to grade ambiguity during school terms and is a way for people to be more organized when it comes to their grades.
This application is currently in Alpha stage and updates are surely to come.
